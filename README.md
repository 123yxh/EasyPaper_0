### 📝 Key Features

#### ✨ Smart Literature Search
- Provide your search requirements and keywords to retrieve the most relevant papers from arXiv, IEEE, and SciHub.
- Requires registration with a model provider and API key.

- Currently supports DeepSeek and Silicon Flow models (more options coming soon).

- **Note**: Larger models deliver better analysis but require more processing time.


#### ✨ Single/Multiple Document Analysis

- Upload PDFs and interact with our AI model to get answers to your questions.

- Multiple PDF parsing options available.

- MinerU Parser: Delivers detailed analysis and supports image extraction (slower processing).
